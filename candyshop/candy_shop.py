# We run a Candy shop where we sell candies and lollipops
# One lollipop's price is 10$
# And it made from 5gr of sugar
# One candie's price is 20$
# And it made from 10gr of sugar
# we can raise their prices with a given percentage
#
# Create a CandyShop class
# It can store sugar and money as income. The constructor should take the amount of sugar in gramms.
# we can create lollipops and candies store them in the CandyShop's storage
# If we create a candie or lollipop the CandyShop's sugar amount gets reduced by the amount needed to create the sweets
# We can raise the prices of all candies and lollipops with a given percentage
# We can sell candie or lollipop with a given number as amount
# If we sell sweets the income will be increased by the price of the sweets and we delete it from the inventory
# We can buy sugar with a given number as amount. The price of 1000gr sugar is 100$
# If we buy sugar we can raise the CandyShop's amount of sugar and reduce the income by the price of it.
# The CandyShop should be represented as string in this format:
# "Inventory: 3 candies, 2 lollipops, Income: 100, Sugar: 400gr"
